<u><h2 align="center">About The Department</h2></u>
<hr>
<p align="justify">The department of Computer Science of AMU is one of the oldest and pioneer departments of Computer Science and Information Technology in India.

It came into the existence in the year 1971 with the installation of IBM1130 Computing System, under the umbrella of Computer Centre and later blossomed into an independent department known as "Department of Computer Science" in the year 1988. <br><br>

In the year 1980, VAX11/780 system was purchased from DEC (USA) and installed at the centre, which is one of the first computing systems in India. The approval of two new courses, a three year programme of Master in Computer Application (MCA) and one year programme of Post Graduate Diploma in Computer Application (PGDCA) by the standing committee of the UGC in the year 1982 and the formal introduction of these courses from the session 1983-84, were one of the major landmarks in the development of Computer Science department. <br><br>

Since its establishment, the Department of Computer Science has been not only offering quality education but also meeting the need of time by imparting the updated and latest practical knowledge regarding the computer science and Information technology and at the same time has been catering the technical needs of the university. <br><br>

This department offers the various courses like <span style="font-weight: bold;text-decoration:underline;font-style: italic;font-family:"Times New Roman";>Ph.D., MCA, PGEDP, PGDCP and B.Sc. (Hons.) Computer Application</span> and the syllabi for these courses is designed by keeping under consideration the requirement of time as well as the demand of the IT industry. But any department is known by its research work, therefore in the year 2009, Department of Computer Science yet again witnessed a major breakthrough with the introduction of Research Programme in order to provide an opportunity to the young and enthusiastic IT professional to walk over that extra yard which makes a vital difference and contribute towards the on going IT research and development. <br><br>

Today the Department of Computer Science is one of the growing departments of the Aligarh Muslim University which has central computing lab for both undergraduate and post graduate students. It also has a separate lab for the research scholars.It contain the 24 hr facility of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_area_network" target="_blank">LAN</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi" target="_blank">WIFI</a><br><br>

The guidance and cooperation of the experienced and expert faculty of the department is one of the attracting features of the department, which enlivens the students to stretch their wings, so that they can fly higher than their dreams and serve the country. <br>

Students from both undergraduate and postgraduate courses have been able to secure a place in IT market even before the completion of their final examination, which gives an idea of strong placement in this department. The rigorous training of 4 to 6 month, in the leading IT companies and reputed organizations of the country, in the last year of the B.Sc. (Hons.) Computer Application and MCA courses is the main force behind this unparallel placement hub of the university. There are plethora of companies which visits the department every year for the recruitment of the students, like <span style="font-weight: bold;text-decoration:underline;font-style: italic;font-family:'Courier New'">TCS, Accenture, Infosys, IBM, JK Techno soft, HCL, Info system, NIC, Wipro, Bharti Telesoft</span> and many more.</p>
